# Travel Quote Backend Integration

## Summary

The travel quote journey now uses the **same backend APIs** as the marine cargo quote journey for a unified experience. Quotes are saved to the database and appear on the dashboard under "Saved Quotes" (pending payment).

---

## ‚úÖ Key Changes Implemented

### 1. **Backend API Integration**

The travel quote now uses the same `QuoteService` that powers marine quotes:

```typescript
// Same API endpoint as marine
POST /api/v1/quote
```

**Metadata Structure Sent to Backend:**
```json
{
  "prodName": "Travel Insurance",
  "planName": "Worldwide Plus",
  "coverPeriod": "Up to 7 days",
  "numTravelers": 2,
  "winterSports": false,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "phoneNo": "+254712345678",
  "travelers": [
    {"fullName": "John Doe", "dob": "1990-01-15"},
    {"fullName": "Jane Doe", "dob": "1992-05-20"}
  ],
  "subtotal": 58.06,
  "subtotalKES": 7547.80,
  "groupDiscount": 0,
  "ageSurcharge": 0,
  "winterSportsSurcharge": 0,
  "phcf": 18.87,
  "trainingLevy": 15.10,
  "stampDuty": 40,
  "netprem": 7621.77,
  "description": "Worldwide Plus - Up to 7 days"
}
```

### 2. **Quote Saving Flow**

**Step 2 ‚Üí Step 3 Transition:**
1. User fills in traveler details (Step 2)
2. Clicks "Review & Save Quote"
3. Quote is **automatically saved to backend** via API
4. Backend returns quote with `id` and `refno`
5. User proceeds to Step 3 (Review & Pay)
6. Quote appears on dashboard as "Pending Quote"

### 3. **Payment Integration**

Uses the **same M-Pesa STK Push** as marine quotes:

```typescript
// M-Pesa Payment Flow
this.quoteService.stkPush(phone, amount, refNo)
  .subscribe(...)
```

**Payment Modal Data:**
- Amount: Total payable in KES
- Phone: User's phone number
- Reference: Backend-generated `refno` (e.g., `TRV-123456`)
- Description: Plan name + "Travel Insurance Cover"

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**

Travel quotes now appear in the dashboard's **"Saved Quotes"** section alongside marine quotes:

**Quote Display Information:**
- Product Name: "Travel Insurance"
- Plan: e.g., "Worldwide Plus"
- Cover Period: e.g., "Up to 7 days"
- Premium: KES amount
- Status: "DRAFT" (before payment) or "PAID" (after payment)
- Created Date: Actual timestamp from backend

### 5. **Download Functionality**

Uses the same download API as marine quotes:

```typescript
// Download endpoint
GET /api/v1/quote/download/{quoteId}
```

Returns PDF with:
- Quote reference number
- Plan details
- Traveler information
- Premium breakdown
- Payment status
